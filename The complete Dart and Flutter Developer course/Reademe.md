# The complete Dart & Flutter Development course 

This will be my personal notes of the course I found on youtube. The link to the course is given below. I will try to finish about 30 mins of the video everyday and about 1 hr on weekends. So, I should be able to complete the course in about 4 weeks.

## What is Dart

Dart is a programming language developed by Google. It shares similarities with other programming language like JS and Java. 

## Why use Dart?

The primary reason why people use Dart is because we want to learn Flutter. Flutter allows us to develop apps for IOS, Android and Windows with a single code base. Dart is not only used to build the UI. It can also be used to build the back-end, databases and even servers.

## Compilation Process

Dart comes with 2 compilation processes. 

Compilation means the process of converting the source code in machine code. Dart using two types of compilation process, namely,

Just in Time - JIT
Ahead of Time - AOT

### Just in Time: 
During the development Dart uses JIT compilation which allows for fast iterations and immediate feedback. Which effectively reduces the compilation times and makes the development faster. 

### Ahead of Time:
At the end of the development it is adviced to use the AOT compilation. AOT compilation produces more optimized machine code, this reduces the execution time, making the application more efficient.
