# **Rust vs. C/C++: A Comparative Analysis**

## **Slide 1: Introduction**
- Introduce the topic: Comparsion between Rust and C/C++ programming languages.
- Briefly mention the popularity of both languages in systems programming and their strengths.

## **Slide 2: Overview of Rust**
- Highlight Rust as a modern systems programming language.
- Emphasize its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency.
- Mention that Rust is designed to be memory-safe and thread-safe by default.

## **Slide 3: Overview of C/C++**
- Discuss C/C++ as traditoional systems programming languages.
- Point out their widespread usage and long-established history.
- Mention that C/C++ provide low-level control and are widely used in various industries.

## **Slide 4: Pros of Rust**
1. **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership system and borrow checker ensure that there are no null pointer dereferences or data races, reducing bugs and crashes.
2. **Concurrency:** Rust's lightweight, efficient, and safe concurrency model using 'async/await' helps write concurrent code with fewer issues.
3. **Strong Type System:** Rust's type system helps catch more errors at compile time, leading to robust and reliable code.
4. **Package Ecosystem:** Rust's package manager 'Cargo' simplifies dependency management and promotes code reusability.
5. **Pattern Matching:** Rust's powerful pattern matching improves code readability and simplifies handling different cases.

## **Slide 5: Cons of Rust**
1. **Learning Curve:** Rust's strict ownership rules and borrow checker can be challenging for newcomers, especially those from non-systems programming backgrounds.
2. **Smaller Ecosystem & Community:** Compared to C/C++, Rust's ecosystem and community zis still growing, and it may have fewer libraries and tools for specific use cases.
3. **Compile Times:** Rust's strong type system and borrow checker can lead to longer compile times, especially for larger projects.
4. **Limited Legacy Support:** Rust doesn't have direct support for some legacy systems and hardware, which may be better served by C/C++.
5. **Unsafe Code:** While Rust promotes safety, it allows developers to write unsafe code when necessary, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
6. **Non-Standardised:** Rust is not a standardised language. So, there can be drastic changes in the code sytax or functionalities between updates. It has happened so in the past.

## **Slide 6: Pros of C/C++**
1. **Legacy Support:** C/C++ are well-etsablished languages with extensive support for legacy systems and hardware.
2. **Performance:** Being low-level languages, C/C++ provide more control over hardware, leading to highly efficient code.
3. **Extensive Libraries:** C/C++ have a vast collection of libraries and frameworks for various domains and industries.
4. **Mature Tools:** C/C++ have been around for a long time, resulting in a mature ecosystem with robust tools and development environments.
5. **Wider Adoption:** C/C++ are still heavily used in industries like gaming, embedded systems, and real-time applications.

## **Slide 7: Cons of C/C++**
1. **Memory Errors:** C/C++ allow direct memory manipulation, which can lead to memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other memory-related errors.
2. **Concurrency Complexity:** Writing concurrent code in C/C++ can be error-prone and challenging, leading to potential race conditions.
3. **Null Pointers:** C/C++ allow the use of null pointers, which can lead to crashes and undefined behavior if not handled properly.
4. **Lack of Modern Features:** C/C++ lack some modern language features present in Rust, making certain tasks more cumbersome.
5. **Security Concerns:** Due to unsafe coding practices, C/C++ code can be susceptible to security vulnerabilities.

## **Slide 8: Conclusion**
- Summarize the main points of the presentation.
- Emphasize that Rust excels in safety, concurrency, and modern language features.
- Highlight that C/C++ offer legacy support, extensive libraries, and are still widely used in specific domains.
- Conclude that the choice between Rust and C/C++ depends on the project's requirements, team expertise, and priorities.

## **Slide 9: Q&A**
- Reserve this slide for addressing any questions from the audience.
